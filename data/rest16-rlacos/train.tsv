it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .	7,8 HARDWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 3,4

reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#QUALITY 0 3,4	41,43 DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 -1,-1

none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !	5,8 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 20,21
i led with those first five points for a reason : being able to purchase a decently - performing chromebook with aluminum build , a 1080p ips display , 4gb of ram , 32gb of local storage , and an intel quad - core processor for $ 299 is basically what the entirely of the chromeos subreddit has been asking for over the past few years .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS 2 16,17

with how slim this thing is i really don ' t see a need for the macbook air line .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 2,3
the display is fantastic on this laptop .	1,2 DISPLAY#GENERAL 2 3,4
battery life : i haven ' t had the laptop for too long but easily get 8 hours or more on a charge .	0,2 BATTERY#GENERAL 2 -1,-1
the keyboard is ok .	1,2 KEYBOARD#GENERAL 1 3,4
other than that , the key sizes are good and the backlighting works just fine .	5,6 KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 8,9	11,12 KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 14,15
the trackpad has gotten better with this new model .	1,2 HARDWARE#GENERAL 2 4,5
the click is now provided by a haptic engine and provides more functionality .	1,2 HARDWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 -1,-1
the thing is fantastic .	-1,-1 HARDWARE#GENERAL 2 3,4
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .	5,6 KEYBOARD#GENERAL 2 4,5
apps open instantly and the ac wifi performance is very nice .	0,1 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 2,3	5,7 PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 10,11
you can even run time machine backups while the computer is sleeping now .	5,7 SOFTWARE#USABILITY 2 -1,-1
i ' m not sure when this feature was introduced , but it is very welcome .	7,8 SOFTWARE#GENERAL 2 15,16
the os is easy to use , the app store lacks many apps that i use , so i have to go directly to the developers site to download them .	1,2 OS#USABILITY 2 3,4	8,10 SOFTWARE#GENERAL 0 -1,-1
i have not messed with the continuity feature much , but it is nice having the favorites and open tabs sync from my laptop to my iphone .	6,8 SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 13,14	6,8 SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 16,17
the current model only has two , which can be problematic if you hook up an external hard drive and an external bluray drive ( which requires two ports ) at the same time .	2,3 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 10,11
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .	13,14 LAPTOP#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
it ' s nice and lightweight , the sd port is useful , and it ' s powerful enough for me to do fairly layer intensive graphic design work in photoshop and basic grading in lightroom .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 3,4	-1,-1 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 17,18	-1,-1 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 5,6	8,10 PORTS#USABILITY 2 11,12

the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .	2,3 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 4,5	2,3 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 6,7
the force touch trackpad works great .	1,4 HARDWARE#GENERAL 2 5,6
overall , i feel this is the best laptop i ' ve ever purchased or used .	8,9 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 7,8

i waited for a while before writing a review about this product .	11,12 LAPTOP#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
after a couple of months of using this product , i finally could say that it ' s the best thing that i have ever bought up to this moment .	8,9 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 19,20
regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged , the inside box was fine .	6,8 SHIPPING#GENERAL 0 9,10	12,14 SHIPPING#GENERAL 2 15,16
i use this laptop every single day for at least 2 hours and believe me it ' s just great .	3,4 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 19,20
therefore , my advice to you if you ' re a student and you need a laptop for school , this laptop is the best choice for you .	16,17 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 24,25
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .	8,9 OS#USABILITY 2 30,32
i ' m glad i got this .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 3,4
amazon warehouse marked this as ` ` like new ` ` but upon receiving , this unit was brand new .	15,17 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 -1,-1
i am very happy with this purchase especially for the price .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#PRICE 2 3,4
at the time of this posting , this model was going only for 1800 for the 512gb with a dedicated video card .	8,9 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 -1,-1
win for the ports , win for the price , and win for a brand new unopened macbook .	3,4 PORTS#GENERAL 2 -1,-1	-1,-1 LAPTOP#PRICE 2 -1,-1	17,18 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 -1,-1
love love love this laptop !	4,5 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 1,2	4,5 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 2,3	4,5 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 -1,-1
the display is excellent !	1,2 DISPLAY#GENERAL 2 3,4
you can actually take a picture of this screen and not have near the amount of wavy lines that you used to get .	8,9 DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 -1,-1
i really like the fact that when it boots up , it ' s up .	8,10 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 2,3
this thing boots up , you log in and you ' re ready to go !	2,4 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 -1,-1
my review is based on the fact that i got a pretty good value on this when it was selling for $ 200 less than normal .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#PRICE 2 12,13
i ' m probably a bit biased on macs since i ' m a professional graphic designer , and it ' s just the industry standard .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#GENERAL 1 6,7
if you ' re considering a switch from windows based pcs to apple computers , i ' d probably recommend that you look at what you ' re going to use it for .	12,14 LAPTOP#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
for some of us , even though they are more expensive , they still offer the better value .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#PRICE 0 10,11	-1,-1 LAPTOP#QUALITY 2 16,17
fantastic computer !	1,2 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 0,1
i was due to upgrade and this product seemed perfect for me .	7,8 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 9,10
i have had three macbook pro ' s and all have been excellent .	4,8 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 12,13
the key board is one of the best i ' ve ever typed on .	1,3 KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 7,8
this is my first ever macbook and i will never go back .	5,6 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 -1,-1
i think the mbp ticks off more of the nice - to - have boxes for me than the xps13 overall .	3,4 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 -1,-1
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .	1,2 LAPTOP#QUALITY 1 -1,-1
the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ) .	1,3 BATTERY#GENERAL 2 6,7
the trackpad is the ultimate difference - maker for me .	1,2 KEYBOARD#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .	1,3 KEYBOARD#GENERAL 2 4,5
the mbp 13 ` ` is plenty mobile .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#PORTABILITY 2 -1,-1
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .	11,12 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 2,3	34,38 SOFTWARE#GENERAL 1 -1,-1	41,42 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 -1,-1
adobe apps are also power hogs , but that is to be expected .	0,2 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 1 -1,-1
i also feel like apple hides too much under the hood from the user , but i suppose you can still work around that if you are so inclined .	4,5 COMPANY#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
an unexpected benefit for me has been the iphone / mbp integration .	8,12 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 2,3
i love the airdrop and receiving imessages on my mbp ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .	3,4 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 1,2	-1,-1 SOFTWARE#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
overall , it ' s a great machine .	7,8 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 6,7
it ' ll be interesting to see what the revisions are in 2016 , but i was worried about the shallow keys of the new macbook making their way to the mbp and the loss of port options with a new revision , so i am very happy to have this now .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 47,48
it works great !	-1,-1 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 2,3
i updated it to high sierra and it ' s running smoothly so far .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 11,12
battery life is good , screen looks fine , and all of the keys and ports are functional .	0,2 BATTERY#GENERAL 2 3,4	5,6 DISPLAY#GENERAL 2 7,8	13,14 KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 17,18	15,16 PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 17,18
the only thing i didn ' t like is the big dent on the front of the lid .	11,12 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 5,8
this was a outstanding upgrade from the early 2013 650m model .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 3,4
as far as gaming performance , the m370x does quite well .	7,8 GRAPHICS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 10,11
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .	21,22 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 24,25
with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .	18,19 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 15,16
nothing beats the quality of the mac os x as well , which is one of the main reasons for this purchase .	6,9 OS#GENERAL 2 -1,-1
but i fed up with the price it cost to upgrade the product as well as the software .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#PRICE 0 2,4
i ventured back to the macbook pro world and purchased this model after much research .	11,12 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 -1,-1
one of the first things i noticed after firing up this device was how quiet and effortlessly it performs all tasks that i ask of it .	11,12 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 14,15	11,12 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 16,17

you can right - click by using two fingers to tap the track pad at the same time ( or 2 fingers on the touchpad , using one of them to press press down / click the touchpad ) .	24,25 HARDWARE#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
the feel of the touchpad is not as smooth ( frictionless ) as others i have used , but it ' s not terrible either .	4,5 KEYBOARD#USABILITY 1 22,24
however , it does feel like a sturdy hinge .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 7,8
the screen does not wobble as there is a good amount of friction holding it where you put it .	1,2 DISPLAY#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
reserve your judgement until you ' ve updated the software entirely .	9,10 SOFTWARE#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
giving lower stars for not realizing its limited capabilities is your own fault .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 1 -1,-1

one place that does frustrate me in the tablet mode is that chromeos has a number of ui features that don ' t lend themselves to touch interaction .	12,13 OS#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 4,5

most of my love for this laptop is based on the operating system but since you get that with every chromebook , i ' ll tell you what i like and dislike about the physical laptop only .	35,36 OS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 3,4

i really liked that this chromebook came with 64gb of space but i really don ' t see how someone may fill that up unless they opt to sync their google drive offline or something .	5,6 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 2,3
i wish the display was able to go about 1 or 2 clicks brighter and about 1 click darker at the lowest setting .	3,4 DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 -1,-1
the speaker volume is decent but the quality of sound is terrible .	1,3 MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#GENERAL 0 4,5	7,10 MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY 0 11,12
